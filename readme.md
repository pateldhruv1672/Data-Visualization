## 🌟 Project Highlights
* **Comprehensive EDA:** Processed 42 variables across 10,000 records.
* **Geospatial Insights:** Visualized flight paths using start/end coordinates.
* **Predictive Indicators:** Analyzed the impact of weather (Stormy, Windy) on migration success.
* **Interactive Storytelling:** Built a dynamic Power BI dashboard for stakeholders.

## 🛠️ The Analysis Workflow

### 🔍 Phase 1: Python Exploratory Analysis (`.ipynb`)
Using **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**, we uncovered:
- **Migration Success Rates:** Correlated habitat types and weather conditions.
- **Data Quality:** Handled missing values (e.g., "Interrupted" column) and outliers.
- **Flight Metrics:** Average speed, altitude, and distance distribution across species.

### 📊 Phase 2: Power BI Dashboard (`.pbix`)
An interactive report designed with a custom **"Birds Dashboard Theme"** featuring:
- **Researcher Performance:** Comparative analysis of tracking by Researcher A, B, and C.
- **Weather Impact:** Real-time filtering of migration outcomes based on environmental stressors.
- **Species Explorer:** Dynamic drill-downs into specific bird behaviors.

### 💡 Extra Professional Tips for your GitHub:

1.  **Add a `GIF` or Screenshot:** GitHub allows you to display images. Take a screenshot of your Power BI dashboard and your best Python chart, then add them to a folder named `screenshots`. You can then embed them in the README using:
    `![Dashboard Screenshot](./screenshots/dashboard_preview.png)`
2.  **GitHub Pages:** Since you mentioned GitHub Pages, you can export your Jupyter Notebook as an **HTML** file (`index.html`) and enable Pages in settings. This allows recruiters to see your code and charts in a browser without downloading anything\!
